# SuperPing
SuperPing is a work-in-progress, super responsive ping API which allows developers to aquire a player's nearly instantaneous ping. It is a super responsive system: player's ping is upated for every packet recieved from them, with keepalive packets sent every tick in order to correct any errors. In a sense, ping is updated nearly continuously!
